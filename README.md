This is the game made by me using the Python framework pygame. 

Hello guys I have created this game called Table tennis. 
Well, this is not that good because there are still some problems to solve, but the game can still be played.

Game ControlS...
Well, this game is 2 player game so you need to tag along with another player to play.
I have altered the control of players: What I mean to say is that player 1 control is going to be played by player 2 control and ViceVersa.

Controls:
Player 1:
 TO GO UP: Use Up Arrow
 To GO DOWN: Use Down Arrow

Player 2:
  TO GO UP: Use (W) Key
  To GO DOWN: Use (S) Key


Some Problems With Game:
 There is some problem in-game. 
 Like in Distance between the ball and the player1 and ball and the player 2(Some Time the ball don't even touch the player1/player2 but gets bounce without touching them)
 So I want someone to help me with this distance problem
